Code I have modified:
samples.cc 
analysis.cc 
oxford.cc 
detector.cc
oxford_sideband.cc
oxford_atalas_qcd.cc 
samples.h
analysis.h
oxford.h
oxford_sideband.h
oxford_atlas_qcd.h

I added finalState const& higgsfs to all the analysis function that is called.
Then I added some lines in the oxford.cc to test if the new code can tell if
higgs are inside the largeR jet (I have commented out this part).
This is for the purpuse of checking how many jets contain a true Higgs with two b quarks.
Also the definition of jets are modified to match the pubnote. 
I also turn off the tagger in the code, which is oxford.cc (line 793) and oxford_atlas_qcd.cc (line 389).
